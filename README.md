AgriConnect: A Fully Functioning Website for Farmers

AgriConnect is a web-based platform that connects farmers with NASA's satellite and geospatial datasets, providing them with valuable insights to improve their farming practices and address water-related concerns. The platform aims to make remote sensing data accessible and actionable for farmers, enabling them to make data-driven decisions and optimize their water usage.

Core Features:

Data Detective: A user-friendly interface that allows farmers to search and explore NASA's remote sensing data, including satellite imagery and geospatial datasets.
Crop Challenges: A gamification feature that encourages farmers to explore and evaluate data, with rewards and recognition for achieving milestones and completing challenges.
Farming Fusion: A data integration feature that combines NASA's remote sensing data with farmers' own field observations, providing personalized insights and recommendations.
Data Dashboard: A clear and informative dashboard that provides farmers with a comprehensive view of their farm's risk of limited water access or flooding, including current and historical values for key environmental factors.
Ask the Agricultural Experts: A Q&A feature that connects farmers with a network of subject matter experts, providing them with practical advice and guidance based on real-world data.
